# Personal Technology Sniffer

This project is made for my Bachelor's finalwork. It enables you to monitor your own "Safety levels" by scanning your environment 
for dangerous "Technological activities". (It's a WiFi sniffer, with some personal sensors).

## Getting Started

Some quick guideliness if you wish to run this yourself.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Recent version of Visual Studio Code
* [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) - Open source ecosystem for IoT development

The sensors I used for monitoring health and nervousness.

* [MAX30105 Particle and Pulse Ox Sensor](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/max30105-particle-and-pulse-ox-sensor-hookup-guide/all) - Powerfull multifunctional sensor
* [Grove GSR Sensor](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-GSR_Sensor/) - Galvanic Skin Response sensor

### Installing

Folow the setup tutorial provided by [PlatformIO VSCode setup](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide/vscode.html).
Afterwards open this project via PlatformIO in VSCode.

Make sure you setup the platformio.ini correct for your system.

* Check if the COM port is correct
